# PwC Virtual Internship: Power BI Skills Development
I completed a virtual internship at PwC, where I honed my skills in Power BI through hands-on experience. During this internship, I successfully executed three key tasks: Call Centre Trend Analysis, Customer Retention Analysis, and Diversity and Inclusion Reporting. Each project allowed me to demonstrate my ability to analyze complex data sets,

KPI for Tasks

Call Centre Trend Analysis • Overall customer satisfaction • Overall calls answered/abandoned • Calls by time • Average speed of answer • Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

Customer Retention Analysis • Customers who left within the last month • Services each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies • Customer account information: how long as a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges and number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical • Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

Diversity and Inclusion Reporting • Define relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover, and create a visualisation • Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs: (#)of men (#) of women (#)of leavers % employees promoted (FY21) % of women promoted % of hires men % of hires women % turnover Average performance rating: men Average Performance rating: women
